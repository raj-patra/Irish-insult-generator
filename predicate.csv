and as fragrant as a slurry pit
who'd ask for a change from a penny sweet
with a face even an Irish mammy could'nt love
and the one snake St. Patrick could'nt banish
who needs to massively cop on
who would'nt get a date on a calender
who'd make a fortune haunting houses
with a face like slapped bum
who'd give a potato blight
who stinks of Guinness farts
who needs a good kick up the arse
who would'nt spend Christmas
who makes Mrs. Brown look like a lady
with a roar like Doran's ass
who'd cut turf with a spoon
who'd put hard butter on soft bread
who still has the confirmation money in the pocket
with a face like a constipated greyhound
with a head like a melted welly
who would'nt be taken out by the tide
who'd be out with a fork if it was raining soup
with a neck like a jockey's bollix
who's cat malogen altogether
with teeth like Donegal graveyard
who would give paracetamol a headache
who was bet with the ugly stick
who smells like the business end of a cow
who'd leave a teabag in the sink
who's full of notions
with beef to the heel like a Mullingar heifer
with a voice like a banshee
whose Ma is still scarlet
who can look through a keyhole with both eyes
who's as welcome as a fart on the Luas
and the evil of two lessers
with a face like a bee-keeper's apprentice
and common as muck
with a face like a cat's bum
who never stands thier round
who makes father dougal look like a genius
who's as thick as manure and only half as useful
who was reared on the hind tit
who'd be twice as thick with two brains
who could eat an apple through a letterbox
who'd put brown sauce in tea
who could'nt see sense with a telescope
and as pointless as the spire
who could'nt organise a piss up in the guinness storehouse
who'd leave the immersion on
with a face like a sheep's oxter
